Sorry, but I'm not programmed to handle this case;
I'll just pretend that you didn't ask for it.
If you're in the wrong mode, you might be able to
return to the right one by typing `I}' or `I$' or `I\par'.

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

                   \par 
l.8 
    
The `$' that I just saw supposedly matches a previous `$$'.
So I shall assume that you typed `$$' both times.
